# Current Task

## Current Objectives

- Switch Google Maps API key management to `.env` file using python-dotenv
- Remove shell profile and setup_api_key.sh onboarding
- Ensure backend loads key from `.env` and injects into frontend
- Document new onboarding: user must copy `.env.example` to `.env` and paste their key
- Next: User should add their key to `.env` and restart the server
- Test the application on a Raspberry Pi 4 in a conda environment
- Verify all functionality works as expected

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Google Maps API integration fixes have been successfully implemented!

### What Was Fixed

1. **Travel Time Range Display** 
   - Ranges now display below each input field (e.g., "10-18 min")
   - Backend provides all required `*_display` fields
   - Frontend shows ranges on both page load and after calculation

2. **Commute Route Map** 
   - Route now displays highlighted path from property to Alaska Airlines HQ
   - Map loads correctly with proper API key
   - Directions API working properly

### Critical Fix Applied

**Environment Variable Override Issue**: 
- Root cause was system environment variable `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` overriding `.env` file
- Solution: Unset system env var with `unset GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` and restart server
- Server now correctly loads API key from `.env` file via python-dotenv

### Google Cloud Console Configuration

- **APIs Enabled**: Maps JavaScript API, Directions API, Distance Matrix API
- **Billing**: Enabled (required for Maps APIs)
- **API Key Restrictions**: Limited to the 3 required APIs
- **Application Restrictions**: Set to "None" for local development

## Context
We have completed the development of the Rental Recon application, which includes:
- FastAPI backend with SQLite database
- Frontend with property input form, listing view, and detail view
- Image pasting functionality for the main image
- Multiple image upload support
- Setup and run scripts for Raspberry Pi deployment

The application allows users to manually capture rental property data from Zillow and Redfin, including property details and images.

## Next Steps
1. Transfer the codebase to the Raspberry Pi 4
2. Run the setup script to create the conda environment and install dependencies:
   ```
   bash setup.sh
   ```
3. Start the application:
   ```
   bash run.sh
   ```
4. Test the following functionality:
   - Adding a new property with all details
   - Pasting an image from a web page
   - Adding multiple additional images
   - Viewing the property listing
   - Editing a property
   - Deleting a property
